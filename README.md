Insights into Thermal Conductivity of Pnictogen Chalcogenides: Machine Learning Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs and Hybridization The ML model, trained with screened datasets from the Open Quantum Materials Database, the Materials Project, and experimental reports, achieved a significant reduction in test error scores by using chemical bonding descriptors over conventional features in predicting κ_L values for pnictogen chalcogenides. Our data-driven approach not only identifies promising candidates with ultralow κ_L, but also reveal new avenues for the design of pnictogen-based thermoelectric materials, emphasizing the crucial influence of lone pairs and hybridization.
